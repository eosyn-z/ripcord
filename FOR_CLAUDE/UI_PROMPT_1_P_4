# Specialized Prompt for Claude: Creating the UI for the Client

You are tasked with creating a fully responsive and interactive UI for the client of the decentralized chat platform. The frontend should be minimalistic, with a beige color scheme and red-orange highlights. The UI should replicate core features of a basic chat app (similar to Discord) and should be interactive:

1. **Room List UI**:
   - Display all available rooms in a scrollable list.
   - Provide functionality to join a room by entering an invite code.
   - Show room status (e.g., online/offline).
   - Allow the user to create a new room.

2. **Chat Pane**:
   - Display messages with timestamps, usernames, and message content.
   - Show user avatars or initials.
   - Scrollable chat history with auto-scroll on new messages.
   - Allow users to send messages via the input bar.

3. **Input Bar**:
   - A text box for composing messages.
   - A send button that triggers sending a message to the server.
   - Include the ability to type slash commands like `/join`, `/block`, etc.

4. **User List**:
   - Show a list of participants in the current room.
   - Display each userâ€™s nickname, key fingerprint, and status.
   - Ability to mute/block users directly from the list.

5. **Settings Panel**:
   - A basic preferences panel for toggling theme (light/dark).
   - Settings for managing the blocklist of users.
   - Allow users to view/edit their nickname.

Create the necessary HTML structure, CSS, and JavaScript to ensure full functionality and interactivity.
