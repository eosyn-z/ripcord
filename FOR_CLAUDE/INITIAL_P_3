# Specialized Prompt for Claude: Finalizing Base Content

You are tasked with finalizing the base content generated by Cursor for the decentralized secure chat platform. The content should be expanded to include more functionality and clear placeholders for future additions. Please focus on making sure the project can be built, compiled, and run, with some basic, working features, without going too deep into specifics.

1. **Backend (Go)**:
   - `backend/main.go`:
     - Complete the server setup, including HTTP or WebSocket handlers for communication.
     - Set up routing and basic error handling.
   - `backend/node.go`:
     - Implement basic functionality to initialize the node, assign a public key, and check I2P availability.
     - Create a simple peer-to-peer connection method.
   - `backend/room.go`:
     - Implement functions to create, join, and leave rooms, and add/remove users.
     - Integrate with the message and node systems.
   - `backend/message.go`:
     - Implement logic for sending, receiving, and storing messages.
   - `backend/protocol.go`:
     - Define how messages are serialized and deserialized (JSON).
     - Implement message signature verification and integrity checks.
   - `backend/config.go`:
     - Create a configuration file for I2P integration and node settings.
     - Load configuration during node startup.

2. **Frontend (HTML/CSS/JS)**:
   - `frontend/index.html`:
     - Finalize the page layout (basic containers and meta tags).
     - Link the necessary CSS and JS files.
   - `frontend/app.js`:
     - Integrate the UI with backend (using WebSockets, HTTP, or TCP for communication).
     - Add event listeners and UI updates.
   - `frontend/styles.css`:
     - Flesh out the styling with additional layout, padding, margins, and colors.
   - `frontend/components/ChatPane.js`:
     - Add functionality to display messages and scrollable chat history.
   - `frontend/components/RoomList.js`:
     - Add interactivity to join and leave rooms.
   - `frontend/components/InputBar.js`:
     - Implement message sending functionality and UI updates.
   - `frontend/components/UserList.js`:
     - Display users and their status (online/offline).
   - `frontend/components/SettingsPanel.js`:
     - Basic preferences toggle for themes and other settings.

Please ensure that each file is logically connected and can work in a basic state.
